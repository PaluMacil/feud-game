# feud-game
A simple Family Feud clone with classic questions from fan sites.

This was my first JQuery project ever and I've finally posted it. That said, I have a couple important caveots:
  1. The license is not valid until I obtain formal permission from the original author of the CSS layout, and the questions / answers are probably not free to distribute for commercial purposes.
  2. The Python code should probably not be run without obtaining permission from the owner of the fansite.
  3. The Python code is also the first time I wrote Python, and I have not revised it. I may eventually, but I don't advise you use it as an example of good Python code.  

**To use...**
---------
Unzip the JSON files and place all the files except the .py on a web server. There are play instructions available in the application. 

The Python files were one time use, but you could use them to scrape the fan site again.
